## ‚öíÔ∏èMain Process
### Query 01: Calculate total visit, pageview, transaction for Jan, Feb and March 2017 (order by month)
**Purpose:** Aggregates 3 key metrics (visits, pageviews, transactions) by month (Jan‚ÄìMar 2017).  
**Goal:** Detect seasonal performance trends and identify which months bring better engagement.
```sql
select 
  format_date('%Y%m',parse_date('%Y%m%d', `date`)) as month,
  count(totals.visits) as visits,
  sum(totals.pageviews) as pageviews,
  sum(totals.transactions) as transactions
from `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`
where _table_suffix between '0101' and '0331'
group by month
order by month;
```
** ‚úÖ Results:** 
| month   | visits | pageviews | transactions |
|---------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| 201701  | 64,694 | 257,708   | 713          |
| 201702  | 62,192 | 233,373   | 733          |
| 201703  | 69,931 | 259,522   | 993          |

**üìù Observation:** The table shows monthly aggregated metrics. March (201703) demonstrates an improvement across all key indicators‚Äîvisits, pageviews, and transactions‚Äîcompared to January and February.
### Query 02: Bounce rate per traffic source in July 2017 (Bounce_rate = num_bounce/total_visit) (order by total_visit DESC)
**Purpose:** Calculates bounce rate = bounces / visits per source.  
**Goal:** Evaluate traffic quality by source and identify underperforming channels.
```sql
select
    trafficSource.source as source,
    sum(totals.visits) as total_visits,
    sum(totals.bounces) as total_no_of_bounces,
    round((sum(totals.bounces)/sum(totals.visits))* 100.00,2) as bounce_rate
from `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*`
group by source
order by total_visits DESC;
```
** ‚úÖ Results:** 
| source | total_visits | total_no_of_bounces | bounce_rate |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------------- | ----------- |
| google | 38400 | 19798 | 51.56 |
| (direct) | 19891 | 8606 | 43.27 |

    'month' as time_type,
    format_date('%y%m', date(parse_date('%y%m%d', date))) as time,
    trafficsource.source as source,
    sum(product.productrevenue) / 1000000 as revenue
from `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201706*`,
unnest(hits) as hit,
unnest(hit.product) as product
where product.productRevenue is not null
group by time, source

union all 

select
    'week' as time_type,
    format_date('%y%w', date(parse_date('%y%m%d', date))) as time,
    trafficsource.source as source,
    sum(product.productRevenue) / 1000000 as revenue
from `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201706*`,
unnest(hits) as hit,
unnest(hit.product) as product
where product.productRevenue is not null
group by time, source

order by time_type, revenue desc;
```

```sql
with 
purchaser_data as(
  select
      format_date("%Y%m",parse_date("%Y%m%d",date)) as month,
      round((sum(totals.pageviews)/count(distinct fullVisitorId)),2) as avg_pageviews_purchase,
  from `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`
    ,unnest(hits) hits
    ,unnest(product) product
  where _table_suffix between '0601' and '0731'

  and product.productRevenue is not null
  group by month
),

non_purchaser_data as(
  select
      format_date("%Y%m",parse_date("%Y%m%d",date)) as month,
      sum(totals.pageviews)/count(distinct fullVisitorId) as avg_pageviews_non_purchase,
  from `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`
      ,unnest(hits) hits
    ,unnest(product) product
  where _table_suffix between '0601' and '0731'
  and totals.transactions is null
  and product.productRevenue is null
  group by month
)

select
    pd.*,
    round(avg_pageviews_non_purchase,2) as avg_pageviews_non_purchase
from purchaser_data pd
full join non_purchaser_data using(month)
order by pd.month; 
```
** ‚úÖ Results:** 
| month  | avg_pageviews_purchase | avg_pageviews_non_purchase |

        sum(totals.transactions)/count(distinct fullVisitorId)
        ,3) as Avg_total_transactions_per_user
from `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*`
    ,unnest (hits) hits,
    unnest(product) product
where  totals.transactions>=1
and product.productRevenue is not null
group by month;
```
** ‚úÖ Results:** 
| month  | Avg_total_transactions_per_user |
| ------ | ------------------------------- |
| 201707 | 4.164                           |

**Goal:** Estimate effectiveness of purchase sessions in terms of revenue.
```sql
select
    format_date("%Y%m",parse_date("%Y%m%d",date)) as month,
    round(
      ((sum(product.productRevenue)/sum(totals.visits))/power(10,6))
      ,2) as avg_revenue_by_user_per_visit
from `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*`
  ,unnest(hits) hits
