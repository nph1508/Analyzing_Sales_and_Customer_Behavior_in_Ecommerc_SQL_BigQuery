| totals.visits                        | INTEGER   | The number of sessions (for convenience). This value is 1 for sessions with interaction events. The value is null if there are no interaction events in the session. |

| hits.eCommerceAction                 | RECORD    | This section contains all of the ecommerce hits that occurred during the session. This is a repeated field and has an entry for each hit that was collected. |

Example query to calculate number of products in list views:SELECT COUNT(hits.product.v2ProductName) FROM [foo-160803:123456789.ga_sessions_20170101] WHERE hits.product.isImpression == TRUE Example query to calculate number of products in detailed view: SELECT COUNT(hits.product.v2ProductName), FROM [foo-160803:123456789.ga_sessions_20170101] WHERE hits.ecommerceaction.action_type ='2' AND ( BOOLEAN(hits.product.isImpression) IS NULL OR BOOLEAN(hits.product.isImpression) == FALSE ) |
