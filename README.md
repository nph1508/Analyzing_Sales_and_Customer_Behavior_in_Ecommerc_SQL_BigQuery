| Field Name                            | Data Type | Description |
|--------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| fullVisitorId                        | STRING    | The unique visitor ID. |
| date                                 | STRING    | The date of the session in YYYYMMDD format. |
| totals                               | RECORD    | This section contains aggregate values across the session. |
| totals.bounces                       | INTEGER   | Total bounces (for convenience). For a bounced session, the value is 1, otherwise it is null. |
| totals.hits                          | INTEGER   | Total number of hits within the session. |
| totals.pageviews                     | INTEGER   | Total number of pageviews within the session. |
| totals.visits                        | INTEGER   | The number of sessions (for convenience). This value is 1 for sessions with interaction events. The value is null if there are no interaction events in the session. |
| totals.transactions                  | INTEGER   | Total number of ecommerce transactions within the session. |
| trafficSource.source                 | STRING    | The source of the traffic source. Could be the name of the search engine, the referring hostname, or a value of the `utm_source` URL parameter. |

| hits.eCommerceAction                 | RECORD    | This section contains all of the ecommerce hits that occurred during the session. This is a repeated field and has an entry for each hit that was collected. |

Click through of product lists = 1, Product detail views = 2, Add product(s) to cart = 3, Remove product(s) from cart = 4, Check out = 5, Completed purchase = 6, Refund of purchase = 7, Checkout options = 8, Unknown = 0. Usually this action type applies to all the products in a hit, with the following exception: when hits.product.isImpression = TRUE, the corresponding product is a product impression that is seen while the product action is taking place (i.e., a "product in list view"). Example query to calculate number of products in list views:SELECT COUNT(hits.product.v2ProductName) FROM [foo-160803:123456789.ga_sessions_20170101] WHERE hits.product.isImpression == TRUE Example query to calculate number of products in detailed view: SELECT COUNT(hits.product.v2ProductName), FROM [foo-160803:123456789.ga_sessions_20170101] WHERE hits.ecommerceaction.action_type ='2' AND ( BOOLEAN(hits.product.isImpression) IS NULL OR BOOLEAN(hits.product.isImpression) == FALSE ) |
| hits.product                         | RECORD    | This row and nested fields will be populated for each hit that contains Enhanced Ecommerce PRODUCT data. |
| hits.product.productQuantity         | INTEGER   | The quantity of the product purchased. |

| hits.product.productSKU              | STRING    | Product SKU. |
| hits.product.v2ProductName           | STRING    | Product Name. |
